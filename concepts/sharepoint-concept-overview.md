# SharePoint sites and content API overview

SharePoint is your mobile, intelligent intranet.  With SharePoint you can share and manage content, knowledge and applications to empower teamwork, quickly find information, and seamlessly collaborate across the organization.

## Why integrate with SharePoint sites and content?

### SharePoint sites power many of your high value collaboration and communication scenarios

- Team sites store the information you’re collaborating on with your coworkers, whether you’re using Office 365 Groups or Microsoft Teams you’ll have a SharePoint team site behind you.
- Communication sites and portals allow you to publish rich content pages to share across your organization.
- Each site contains a mix of lists and document libraries.

### Store your business data in SharePoint lists

- Lists can be used to store business data ranging from a simple customer contact list to data for an issue tracker.
- Lists can have custom schemas associated with them making them incredibly flexible.

### Document Libraries are lists that store files

- You can access a Document Library as you would any other list or as a Drive resource.
- Just like a regular list you can extend the schema of a Document Library to support your business needs with custom columns.

### Pages are rich web pages created directly in SharePoint

- Build rich web pages with responsive layouts using a modern authoring engine.
- Pages are made up of content and web parts.
- Custom Web parts allow you to integrate  
- Today Pages are accessed as files in the unique Site Pages Document Library.

### Use Microsoft Graph to enrich your custom solutions with your SharePoint intranet data

- Integrate list data with custom line-of-business apps, create new lists or update existing list data
- Upload files for collaboration or archiving
- Build custom schema by adding columns to your sites and lists
- And much more!

### Use Microsoft Graph to extend SharePoint

As a platform, SharePoint provides several models for extension and integration.

- The [SharePoint Framework][] provides a way to build web parts using client-side technologies and open source tooling that can be hosted on SharePoint pages.
- [SharePoint Add-ins][] are self-contained extensions that can be added to a SharePoint site without the need for custom code to run on the server.

To learn about these models in more detail, visit the [SharePoint Dev Center][] or the [SharePoint Developer Docs][].
