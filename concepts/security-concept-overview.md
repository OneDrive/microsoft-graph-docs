# Overview of security in Microsoft Graph (preview) 

Microsoft Graph lets you integrate with security capabilities in Azure Active Directory to detect identity risks. It also lets you connect with Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to leverage Microsoft and security partner resources, and build better threat response solutions. 

## Why use Azure Active Directory to protect identities in your organization?

{Michael - Please start by describe why protecting identities is important to an organization. Extract from this [getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection#getting-started) section which describes why all identities should be protected, and users identified to be at risk should be protected from further abuse. 

Then list the kinds of identity risks that the ID protection API detects. 

Then complete this section by recommending what can be done with the detected data - configure risk-based policies, and so on.}
