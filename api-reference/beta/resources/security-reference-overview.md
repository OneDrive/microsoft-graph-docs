# Use the Microsoft Graph API for security threat detection and protection (preview)

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Today's security breaches often times start with attackers gaining access to a user's identity in an environment. Having access to even a low-privileged user account makes it possible for attackers to gain access to important organization resources. The [identity protection API](identityprotection_root.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you [integrate with Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-graph-getting-started), and detect potential vulnerabilities affecting identities in your organization.

{Edward - please add a similar high-level background intro for the security API. One para is fine, no need to link to individual APIs as security-api-overview.md should be doing that. Avoid repeating what is in security-api-overview.md at length.}
